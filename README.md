# SpikeBit compression
SpikeBit is an architecture for integrating multiple massive parallel recordings of spiketrains using high-speed Ethernet.

## Install
1. See dependencies below
2. Run: `$ python3 setup.py build_ext`
3. Run: `$ python3 setup.py install` (will download missing python packages if pip is installed)

## Usage
For server, run: `$ spikebit-server`
For client, run: `$ spikebit-client`

### Common arguments: 
* --nch - number of channels (default 1000)
* --bufsz - message window lenth (20 recommended, default)
* --fs - bin sampling frequency (default 1000)
* --port - port to connect to on server/sport listening on server (default 29170)
* --simsz - size of simulation, number of complete messages to send (default 100)

### Client arguments:
* --host - server to connect to (default localhost)

### Server arguments:
* --nsys - number of clients to connect to
* --filename - filename to use for hdf5 file

### Filename

## Hardware configuration
- CPU(s) with support for as many threads (that is, total number of cores) as acquisition systems that are connected to is strongly recommended. 
- Please consider high performance storage device for data files, such as solid stated drive(s). If recording over longer periods of time, please also consider performance capacity. 
- GbE or if possible 10GbE as Ethernet medium is highly recommended.

## Dependencies (in order of suggested installation order)
- Linux/OS - SpikeBit is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 but most distributions would probably do. The following packages need to be installed using apt package manager: `openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev` 
- MPI - our solution has run using openmpi 1.10.2, but in general other mpi implementations such as mpich would probably be fine. 
- hdf5 -  We have tested using hdf version 1.8.16 You may either install package `libhdf5-openmpi-dev` or  be compiled and installed  from source using the following options. Compilation is made with the following option: `$./configure --enable-parallel --enable-shared`
- Python3 - we have developed and tested SpikeBit using python 3.5.2. The following packages needs to be installed using `pip`: `numpy mpi4py cython python-lzf`. h5py needs to be compiled and installed separately with [mpi support](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/mpi.html#building-against-parallel-hdf5)
